Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  Assuming you are logged onto your GitHub account, you should be able to find a plus sign in the upper right hand corner of any GitHub page.
  Click on that plus and click "Repository." Provide a repository name and choose if you want the repo public or private. Choose a lisence and whether or not you want a readme or gitignore. I would recommend Public, with a ReadMe and a MIT license. Now click create repository.

  Now you need to clone this repo. In this repository there should be a box to the right that is labeled "HTTPS clone URL" with a URL in the box. Copy that URL. Open up Command Line (Terminal if on a Mac). Use command line to navigate to the location you want to place this repository. Then type "git clone **PASTE URL**". Hit enter, and you have now cloned the repository.

Describe what open source means.
  Open source means that the source code is open to the public. Anyone can see it, and anyone can copy it, use it or alter it.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  I like the idea of open source because I have seen a lot of successful open source software. I might be more skeptical of it if I had written software that I thought could be either profitable or dangerous.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
  I think that licenses are important if I am going to make anything that I am proud of. I think it is good practice to at least put a MIT lisence on things repositories. For large projects I definitely want a license, and perhaps one more restrictive than MIT.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  This project helped me solidify GitHub workflow. The fact that I can just type in the name of the file to the browser piqued my interest. I hadn't heard of GitHub pages before. My only struggle is that I forgot that I was in phase-0, so I had to re-try outside of it.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  For this challenge, I did not use any extra resources. For a previous challenge, I researched pull requests.

  That link slightly helpful, I think it was a reminder more than anything else.
