## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
To create a new repository, first log in to GitHub via internet browser. Look to the upper right corner where there is a plus sign, and click on it. There should be a scroll down menu in which you select "New Repository". Add a name for the repository, and choose whether you want it to be public or private. There are other options that I did not understand. I added a MIT License. Finally, hit "Create Repository."

To fork a repository, you first have to find a repository that you would like to fork on GitHub. When you have located the repository, look to the upper right hand corner where there is a button that says "Fork." This should create a copy and send it to your account.

To clone a repository, first find the repository on GitHub. On the righthand side there is a URL in a box labeled "HTTPS Clone URL." Copy this URL. Open up your command line, and move to the directory you want to clone the repo to. Type "git clone " and paste the URL after clone on the same line. Hit enter and it shall be cloned!

I believe that you would fork a repository because it copies all of the work to a new repository in your account. If you were to create a new one, it would be empty. Forking seems to be the easiest way to copy the work to your own account.

I don't see where it asks me to define commit, but I'll do it anyways. To be short a commit is an edit that is added to the repository. It is added on the timeline of changes that have been made to that branch.

At first I found GitHub confusing because I did not realize that git was different than GitHub, and I didn't understand how their relationship. Also I was unsure whether to use command-line, browser, or desktop app, and I saw instructions for each. Learning the relationship between git and GitHub was key. Also, now that I understand forking and cloning better, things are starting to make more sense.

I still wonder a bit about how it is used. For instance, if I am working on a project with someone, we'll create a repository on which we can share our work. Then we each fork it to our accounts (maybe optional) and clone it to our systems. Then we create other branches on our system so we can work on it without altering our individual masters. Then we commit the branch to our own  master, and then push this Master to GitHub? It doesn't seem right. I'll find out soon enough I'm sure.
