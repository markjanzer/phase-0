## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

###Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
I really enjoyed the article "Seven counterintuitive ways to be insanely productive." The main idea I get from the article is that we need to treat ourselves like humans instead of task completing machines. Two big points I take away from this article are to favor natural ebbs and flows of productivity over robotic schedules, and to not see productivity as the ultimate goal.

###What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Timeboxing is a way of organizing productivity by the amount of time worked rather than the amount of work completed. It usually has to do with setting aside blocks of time for both work and relaxation. Time boxing can be as simple as setting a timer and telling yourself you are going to work for that amount of time, regardless of the end product. They key is productivity during this time, not the result.

###How do you manage your time currently?
I am currently using the pomodoro technique. I think they key aspect of pomodoro is not mixing the work and the play. I am fine with skipping a break if I feel the need, and I am also fine with extending my break. I just don't want to be working when I am counting the time as relaxing, and I don't want to goof off during my work time.

###Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
My current strategy is working!

###Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I used to regularly meditate and I want to get back into it. I am going to take at least one of my pomodoro breaks each day to meditate.I guess this is also applying a the "start small" rule of habit formation. Cool.

###What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I will use pomodoro timers, and work alongside my friends when possible. I will continue to loosely record my hours per week, aiming for 25 hours a week or completion of all necessary tasks. Most of the time during my pomodoro breaks, I want to take active breaks to move around and give myself energy, but I am going to take one break to meditate per day. I also am going to make sure that I do not let pomodoro override the natural ebb and flow of my productivity.


## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

###What is a shell? What is "bash?"

The shell is a program that takes command from a keyboard (through the command line) and interacts with the operating system. It is running Unix to do this. Bash is one of the shell programs you can use.


###What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

I have briefly gone through the Command Line Crash Course before, I still had some difficulty grasping popd, pushd, and mv. I also don't understand everything that happened in the video, but I was also watching it more to understand what the shell could do.


###Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Not all of the commands in the video, but I was able to use all of the commands from the crash course.


###In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

ls, cd, man, touch, rm, rmdir, cat, mv, cp, vi.


###Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

pwd - prints working directory (tells you where you are)

ls - lists the contents of the working directory

mv - either moves a file to a directory, or renames a file.

cd - changes directory. cd directory/to/change/to    cd .. moves down a directory

../ - this refers to the parent directory of the current working directory

touch - creates a file

mkdir - makes a directory

less - reads the text of a file. Not too sure how it is different from more.

rmdir - deletes a directory

rm - delets files

help - gets help, tells you commands, or tells you more about commands. I'm not too sure about differences between this and man.

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
To create a new repository, first log in to GitHub via internet browser. Look to the upper right corner where there is a plus sign, and click on it. There should be a scroll down menu in which you select "New Repository". Add a name for the repository, and choose whether you want it to be public or private. There are other options that I did not understand. I added a MIT License. Finally, hit "Create Repository."

To fork a repository, you first have to find a repository that you would like to fork on GitHub. When you have located the repository, look to the upper right hand corner where there is a button that says "Fork." This should create a copy and send it to your account.

To clone a repository, first find the repository on GitHub. On the righthand side there is a URL in a box labeled "HTTPS Clone URL." Copy this URL. Open up your command line, and move to the directory you want to clone the repo to. Type "git clone " and paste the URL after clone on the same line. Hit enter and it shall be cloned!

I believe that you would fork a repository because it copies all of the work to a new repository in your account. If you were to create a new one, it would be empty. Forking seems to be the easiest way to copy the work to your own account.

I don't see where it asks me to define commit, but I'll do it anyways. To be short a commit is an edit that is added to the repository. It is added on the timeline of changes that have been made to that branch.

At first I found GitHub confusing because I did not realize that git was different than GitHub, and I didn't understand how their relationship. Also I was unsure whether to use command-line, browser, or desktop app, and I saw instructions for each. Learning the relationship between git and GitHub was key. Also, now that I understand forking and cloning better, things are starting to make more sense.

I still wonder a bit about how it is used. For instance, if I am working on a project with someone, we'll create a repository on which we can share our work. Then we each fork it to our accounts (maybe optional) and clone it to our systems. Then we create other branches on our system so we can work on it without altering our individual masters. Then we commit the branch to our own  master, and then push this Master to GitHub? It doesn't seem right. I'll find out soon enough I'm sure.

## 1.5 Tracking Changes

### How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?
  Tracking and adding helps save progress along the way. It also lets you look back to certain changes and recognize what happens at that point.

### What is a commit?
  A commit is a check point, a way to save your work. It is not as final as pushing it to the repository, but it saves the work that has been completed as a snapshot.

### What are the best practices for commit messages?
  Have a header that is Capitalized, concise and <50 char.

  The body should be separated by a blank line. Paragraphs should be wrapped around 72 characters. Write commit messages in imperative.
  * bullet points are okay too
  * and lists.

### What does the HEAD^ argument mean?
  HEAD^ refers to the previous commit.

### What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?
  When a change is made, it is an unstaged change.
  Then you git add the file to stage it. This makes a staged change.
  When you commit the changes then you have a committed change.

### Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?
  Okay.

### What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?
  A pull request is a request to add code from a branch to another branch (sometimes master branch). You can create one on GitHub by clicking on pull requests and choosing which branch you want to pull the new code from. You or someone else can agree to this request, accept the pull, and delete the old branch.

### Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?
  Pull requests are good because it lets other people look at your work and confirm your submission before adding it to a branch of the repo.
