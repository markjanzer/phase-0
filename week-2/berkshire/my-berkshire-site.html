Mark's and Doug's Relection 2.6

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

A decent amount of it was simple. For instance, paragraph and body tags all made sense.
The most difficult part was by far was adding images in.
-Mark

It was handy, up to this point in terms of experience for HTML, I only a partial HTML track
at codecademy. This help solidfy the concepts!
-Doug

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Mark looked up how to input both a trademark symbol and copyright symbol into our
html file. He also figured out that we needed to add an "alt" tag to our
img in order to make it HTML5 compatible. 

Research wise, it wasn't difficult. Relatively easy to find the answers through
Google.
-Doug and Mark

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

At first, we were missing both "break line" and "paragraph" tags, so we didn't
really have separate paragraphs at the start. Once we took a look at our file,
we realize which areas needed a "break line" or "paragraph" tag. That appears
to be the only formatting we did within this challenge.
-Doug and Mark

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

From my experience, HTML does not seem to be a very flexible programming language. Perhaps though
that it because we haven't learned CSS yet. I do have say though that HTML is very universal and super
useful tool to learn.
-Mark

HTML is boring in my mind. I did a part of the Javascript track on Codecademy and that seemed
a lot more interesting, at the very least JS didn't put me to sleep. As for what's good about
HTML, it seems rather intuitive if not tedious.
-Doug

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Google, it's a great trick. I also keep notes on the side to help me remember certain syntax.
-Mark

I basically do the same as Mark. I have seperate file open on the computer whenever I need
to reference simple syntax. And if I get stuck, I use google as well.
