*How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?*

You can experiment with the formatting and positioning of elements without changing the original. It seems essential to drafting changes (or the creation) of CSS.

*How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?*

You can either change if the element is a block or not and you can change the height and width of elements.


*What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?*

Static positioning is the default, elements will appear in the top left corner of available space, following other static elements.
Relative positioning allows an object to be moved relative to the position it would be in if it were static.
Absolute positioning stays at one location in its parent element, and it will always be in that position.
Fixed position is like absolute, but the parent is the browser window. This means if you scroll up or down, the fixed element will stay in the same place on your screen.

I found fixed easiest to use because it was easy for me to put things where I wanted them to be. I didn't have to understand normal flow or where static elements would go.

I found relative most difficult because it was conceptually the most confusing. However, now that I have better grasp of static, relative seems easier.

*What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?*

Margin is the space around an element, border is the line that separates the element from the margin, and padding is the space in the element between the border and the content.

*What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)*

I really enjoyed this challenge. I found that the freedom to mess experiment with the CSS was very valuable. The only thing I would change is to add more guidance on the positioning. I don't think that codeAcademy explained positioning very well. I learned it because my pair partner had some experience with CSS, so I took the time to talk through all of the positioning with him.
