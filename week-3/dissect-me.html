    <h1>Mark's Snippet</h1>
      <p>
        Let's say I am a sculptor and I am working on a massive marble sculpture of myself. I am chipping away at this marble, shaping a far more muscular version of myself. But something goes wrong. I back up and realize that my biceps are way too small. It's a disaster. If I had version control, I could revert the statue back to a time when I had not yet sculpted the arms. I could even revert the stone to it's original giant slab of marble. I could go back and control whichever version of the project I wanted. But I don't have version control, because stone is not digital, and I am left to wallow in my own unique concoction of vanity and sorrow.

        Git helps you to keep track of changes by meticulously recording every single detail that has occured on the system, remote and local, if the files have been staged, prepped to be tracked by git.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I did not do enough research last week, so I did a little research this morning before the challenge. I found the <section> and <main> tags useful (also header and footer, but we didn't use those today). I find these useful to organize information on the page, and I feel like those are relatively universally appropriate tags (while <article> or <nav> are necessary less often). I return to them because I believe they will help me more than mere <p> or <div> tags when it comes to applying CSS.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Everything is laid out in a straightforward way. The browser seems to read through our document from top to bottom. I imagine if we threw a header in partway through, the computer might see the header and display it up top (and do the same thing for footer), but I am not even sure about that.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned how customizable it is with snippets! I have friends in customer support and they use snippets all the time, so this was very relatable. I will most definitely create more snippets when I find myself repeating myself. It's the same for making functions, D(on't)R(epeat)Y(ourself). I might research shortcuts that already exist, but I will probably only do so after I find that I'm repeating myself. No need for a shortcut for something that I don't do.
