# What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?
# I learned that with psuedocode you want to be explicit about what is returned for each method.

# What are the tradeoffs of using Arrays and Hashes for this challenge?
# Hashes allow you to pair your food items with quantities. An array would make it easy to make an ordered list, but it would be difficult to pair the food with quantities.

# What does a method return?
# A method either returns what you explicitly tell it to return, or the last element evaluated.

# What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
# You can pass any value into methods as arguments, you can even pass methods as arguments.

# How can you pass information between methods?
# You can pass information between methods by assigning the information to variables and passing the variables into the other methods as arguments.

# What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
# I still have a little bit of confusion around the concept of when to use p and puts. I learned that it is generally bad practice to use in methods. I also have a some confusion on using optional arguments, but I can look into that.
