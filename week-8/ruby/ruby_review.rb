# I worked on this challenge by myself
# This challenge took me [#] hours.

# Pseudocode
# I believe the best way to do this would be to run the fibonacci sequence. If the given_number is less than the fibonacci number, the fibonacci sequence will continue. If it is equal, it will return true, and if the fibonacci number is greater, return false.



# Initial Solution

# def is_fibonacci?(num)
#   fib_num = 1
#   prev_num = 1
#   while (num > fib_num)
#     fib_num += prev_num
#     prev_num = fib_num - prev_num
#   end
#   return fib_num == num
# end


# Refactored Solution

def is_fibonacci?(num)
  fib_num = 2
  inc = 1
  while (num > fib_num)
    fib_num += inc
    inc += 1
  end
  fib_num == num || num == 1
end

# Reflection

# What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?
# I learned about the fibonacci sequence, and refactoring it pushed me to think about the sequence in new ways. It was also review for Ruby Syntax.

# What is still confusing to you about Ruby?
# I am still confused about Inheritance, I think I am going to do that challenge next.

# What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?
# Inheritance and Testing! Maybe composition too, I'm not sure what that is. I think I also want to do a bit more work on CSS positioning and SQL many-to-many databases.


# INTRODUCTION TO INHERITANCE (completed November 2nd)


# Cohort variables: name, p0_start_date, immersive_start_date, graduation_date
# LocalCohort variables: city, students, email_list, num_of_students

# Cohort methods: currently_in_phase, graduated?
# LocalCohort methods: add_student, remove_student


#  PSEUDOCODE

# Create class Cohort
#   Initialize name, p0_start_date
#   Create variables immersive_start_date and graduation_date that return values based on p0_start_date

#   Create method currently_in_phase
#     If current date is 0 to 9 weeks after p0_start_date, return Phase 0
#     Else if current date is 10 to 12 weeks after p0_start_date, return Phase 1
#     Else if current date is 13 to 15 weeks after p0_start_date, return Phase
#     Else if current date is 16 to 18 weeks after p0_start_date, return Phase 3
#     If graduated is true, return graduated
#     Else return that the cohort hasn't started.

#   Create method graduated?
#     Return true or false depending on whether the current date is past the graduation date.
# END

# Create class LocalCohort that inherits from Cohort
#   initialize city, students, email_list
#
