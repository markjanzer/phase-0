<!-- Add your reflection here
This challenge took me [1.25] hours.

What did you learn about the DOM?
I learned how to use the DOM! I had read about it and taken some notes, but I had not successfully used it before. I learned how to connect the two documents with an href in the script. I also learned that you select the elements using methods, and then change them using other methods. A lot of the properties are similar to CSS things (at least if it is the style property). I also learned that when a method says getElements etc. it will return an array (regardless of how many items it actually grabs), and if it is getElement etc, it will return a single object (or node?).

I think the most important thing is that I have an example of how it works, and I practiced working with the DOM and finding the correct resources.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
.getByElementId
.setAttribute(attr, setTo)
.getElementsByClassName
.appendChild
.content

Looking forward to learning plenty more!
